**Editor:** Geometry Nodes Editor  
**Node Group:** Hair Nodes (Deformation)

**Core Function:** Averages the position of points along each hair curve, removing sharp angles and kinks to create a smoother, cleaner shape.

**Key Properties & Settings:**

- **Amount (Input):** The primary control for the strength of the smoothing effect. Higher values produce smoother curves. Negative values can be used to create a crumpled, noisy effect.
    
- **Iterations (Input):** The number of times the smoothing algorithm is applied. More iterations result in a significantly smoother, more averaged-out shape.
    
- **Shape (Input):** A falloff that controls the smoothing strength along the length of each hair. This is often used to keep the roots fixed while smoothing the rest of the strand.
    
- **Lock Tips (Input):** When enabled, this prevents the tip of each hair from being moved by the smoothing operation.
    
- **Preserve Length (Input):** Ensures that the hair strands do not shrink as a result of the smoothing, which is a common side effect of averaging point positions.
    

**Practical Application:**  
This node is a general-purpose grooming tool used to clean up the result of other, more chaotic deformation nodes. Imagine you have created a curly hairstyle for a character by applying a Hair Curves Noise node with a high distance, resulting in tight, kinky curls. The curls might have some sharp, jagged "stair-stepping" artifacts due to the resolution of the curves.

- **The Goal:** To soften the procedurally generated curls, removing jagged artifacts and giving them a smoother, more refined appearance.
    
- **The Problem:** The raw output from a noise deformation can be mathematically perfect but visually harsh. The points on the curve form sharp, linear connections that don't look like soft, flowing hair.
    
- **The Solution:** Apply a Smooth Hair Curves node after the noise deformation.
    
    1. Place the Smooth Hair Curves node immediately after the Hair Curves Noise node.
        
    2. Use a moderate Amount and a few Iterations (e.g., 2-5). This will be enough to average out the sharp corners without completely destroying the curly shape.
        
    3. Enable Preserve Length to ensure the curls don't shrink and lose their volume.
        
    4. You can use the Shape falloff to apply less smoothing near the roots, keeping them anchored, and more smoothing towards the tips.
        

The smoothing operation will relax the sharp connections between the points on each curve. This turns the jagged, kinky noise into a much softer and more believable set of curls, acting as a refining pass on the raw deformation.
