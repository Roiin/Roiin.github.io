**Node Group:** Hair Nodes (Guides)

**Core Function:** Collects nearby hair curves and deforms them together into a braided pattern, centered around designated "guide" curves.

**Key Properties & Settings:**

- **Guide Index (Input):** An integer field that defines which hairs belong to which braid. All hairs with the same Guide Index will be braided together. This map is often generated by a Clump Hair Curves or Duplicate Hair Curves node.
    
- - **Factor (Input):** Controls the overall strength of the braiding effect.
        
- **Radius (Input):** Defines the thickness of the resulting braid.
    
- **Frequency (Input):** Controls how tightly the strands are woven together. A higher frequency results in a tighter, more detailed braid.
    
- **Thickness (Input):** Simulates the thickness of the individual strands within the braid, which affects how they overlap.
    
- **Hair Tie (Input):** Allows you to instance a piece of geometry (like a small torus) at the end of the braid to act as a hair tie.
    

**Practical Application:**  
This is a highly specialized node for creating a specific, common hairstyle. It automates the complex process of weaving multiple curves together.

- **The Goal:** To create a classic three-strand braid from a character's ponytail.
    
- **The Problem:** Manually modeling a braid is extremely tedious. A procedural approach requires a way to group a large number of hairs and apply a complex, interwoven deformation to them as a single unit.
    
- **The Solution:** The Braid Hair Curves node is designed for exactly this.
    
    1. First, isolate the hair curves that make up the ponytail.
        
    2. You need to define a single "guide" curve that will be the center of the braid. You can do this by using a Create Guide Index Map node on the ponytail hairs, which will select one central curve and assign all the other hairs to its group.
        
    3. Connect the Guide Index map to the Guide Index input of the Braid Hair Curves node.
        
    4. The node will now treat all the ponytail hairs as a single group and begin to deform them.
        
    5. Adjust the Radius to set the braid's thickness and the Frequency to control the tightness of the weave.
        
    6. You can use the Shape input (driven by a Float Curve node) to make the braid taper naturally towards its end.
        
    7. Finally, you can model a small hair tie object and connect it to the Hair Tie input to automatically place it at the end of the finished braid.
        

The result is a complex, perfectly formed braid created from a simple set of guide curves, a task that would be immensely difficult to achieve with general-purpose deformers.
