- **Node Group:** Mesh (Read)
    
- **Core Function:** For each face in a mesh, this node outputs a boolean value that is True if all of its vertices lie on the same flat plane, and False if they do not. (Note: Triangles are always planar by definition).
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Threshold (Socket - Input):** A small float value that provides a tolerance. A vertex can be this far from the calculated plane and the face will still be considered planar. This is useful for handling minor floating-point inaccuracies.
        
    - **Planar (Socket - Output):** A Boolean field on the Face domain that is True for flat faces and False for bent or warped ones.
        
- **Practical Application:** This node is perfect for creating procedural effects that should only apply to flat, hard surfaces, like placing rivets on the metal panels of a spaceship hull.
    
    1. Imagine your spaceship model is made of many curved and bent surfaces, but also has flat armor panels and maintenance hatches.
        
    2. **The Goal:** You want to procedurally scatter rivet instances, but they should only appear on the perfectly flat panels, not on the curved parts of the hull.
        
    3. Use the Is Face Planar node on your spaceship mesh. The Planar output will be a Boolean mask that is True only for the flat panels.
        
    4. Use this Planar Boolean selection to drive the Selection input of a Distribute Points on Faces node.
        
    5. You can then instance your rivet models onto the points generated by this node.
        
    6. The result is that rivets are automatically and intelligently placed only on the hard, flat surfaces where they belong, and the curved, organic parts of the mesh are correctly ignored. This creates a much more believable and technically accurate result than random scattering.
