**Core Function:** Creates a standard 4x4 transformation matrix from three separate vectors for translation, rotation, and scale.

**Key Properties & Settings:**

- **Translation (Input):** A vector that defines the position component of the transformation.
    
- **Rotation (Input):** A vector representing the Euler rotation (in radians) for the X, Y, and Z axes.
    
- **Scale (Input):** A vector that defines the scale along each axis.
    
- **Transform (Output):** The resulting 4x4 matrix that combines all three transformations.
    

**Practical Application:**  
This node is the standard way to construct a complete transformation when your position, rotation, and scale values are generated by different procedural logic. Imagine you are procedurally placing eyes on the head of a spider model. Each eye's location, orientation, and size needs to be controlled separately.

- **The Goal:** To combine a procedurally determined position, a surface-aligned rotation, and a random scale into a single transformation for an instanced spider eye.
    
- **The Problem:** You might get the eye's location from a Distribute Points on Faces node, its rotation from that same node's Rotation output, and its size from a separate Random Value node. These are three distinct vector outputs. The Transform Geometry node, which can apply this transformation, has a single Transformation socket that accepts one matrix. You need to combine your three separate vectors into that single matrix.
    
- **The Solution:** The Combine Transform node is designed for this exact purpose.
    
    1. Start with a sphere primitive for the eye.
        
    2. Use a point's Position as the Translation vector.
        
    3. Use the point's Rotation (aligned to the surface normal) as the Rotation vector.
        
    4. Use a Random Value node to generate a Scale vector.
        
    5. Feed these three vectors into their respective inputs on the Combine Transform node.
        
    6. Connect the final Transform matrix output into the Transformation socket of a Transform Geometry node that is affecting your eye object.
        

This cleanly packages all the separate transformation components into one matrix, allowing you to correctly place, orient, and size the spider's eye in a single, logical step.
