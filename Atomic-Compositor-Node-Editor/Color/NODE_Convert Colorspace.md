- **Editor:** Compositor Node Editor  
- **Node Group:** Color
    
- **Core Function:** A technical utility node that performs a mathematically precise conversion of an image's color data from one defined color space to another (e.g., from Linear to sRGB, or from Filmic Log to Linear).
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Image (Socket):** The standard color input.
        
    - **From (Property):** The color space of the input image. You must tell the node what it is receiving.
        
    - **To (Property):** The target color space you want to output.
        
- **Practical Application:** This node is the official "translator" for color. While Blender's Color Management handles most things automatically, this node is required when you need to manually override the default behavior or integrate assets from different color pipelines.
    
    - **Important Context (The "Why"):** Different devices (monitors, cameras) and file formats (JPG, EXR, RAW) represent color in different ways. For mathematical operations like lighting and blending to be physically accurate, they must be performed in a Linear color space. This node allows you to move in and out of that linear "working space" correctly.
        
    - **Molecular (Correctly Using sRGB Textures as Data):** This is a very common and important use. Imagine you have a standard sRGB image (like a JPG) that you want to use as a displacement map or a roughness map.
        
        1. By default, when you load the JPG, Blender's color management converts it from sRGB to Linear, which alters the values.
            
        2. For data maps, you don't want this conversion. The correct workflow is to load the image and in the Image node's properties, set its color space to Non-Color.
            
        3. However, if you cannot do that, you can use a Convert Colorspace node. You would take the output of the Image node and convert it From: Linear To: sRGB. This reverses the automatic conversion, restoring the "raw" data from the file for use in your data-driven effects.
            
    - **Organic (Integrating Footage from a Different Pipeline):** Imagine you are working in Blender's default Filmic color space, but a VFX artist from another studio sends you a render in the ACEScg color space.
        
        1. Load their ACEScg render using an Image node.
            
        2. Immediately after the Image node, add a Convert Colorspace node.
            
        3. Set it to convert From: ACEScg To: Linear (Blender's scene-linear space).
            
        4. Now, this external render will behave correctly with all of Blender's internal tools and your own Filmic renders. Without this conversion step, the colors would be completely wrong.
            
    - **Organic (Baking a "Look"):** Let's say you like the look of Blender's Filmic view transform, but you need to send your render to someone who doesn't have that capability. You can "bake" the look into the file.
        
        1. In your node tree, take your final linear composite result.
            
        2. Add a Convert Colorspace node.
            
        3. Set it to convert From: Linear To: Filmic sRGB.
            
        4. Connect this to a File Output node. The resulting image file will have the Filmic look permanently applied to it, and it will look correct on any standard sRGB monitor without needing a special view transform.
