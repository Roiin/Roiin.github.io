- **Node Group:** Color
    
- **Core Function:** Converts a color image into a grayscale (black and white) image by calculating and outputting its luminance. It effectively strips all hue and saturation information, leaving only the brightness values.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Image (Socket):** The standard color input.
        
- **Outputs:**
    
    - **Val (Socket):** A grayscale output representing the calculated luminance of the input image.
        
- **Practical Application:** While you can often get a grayscale image by simply plugging a color output into a value input, this node provides an explicit and clear way to perform the conversion, which is great for readability in complex node trees.
    
    - **Molecular (Artistic Grayscale Conversion):** This is its most direct use. To create a classic black-and-white look for your render, simply pass it through this node. It provides a quick and high-quality desaturation, which can then be fed into an RGB Curves or Brightness/Contrast node to fine-tune the black-and-white image.
        
    - **Molecular (Creating a Luma Key):** This is an extremely common and powerful application. The grayscale output of this node is a perfect luminance map of your image. You can feed this Val output directly into a Color Ramp node to create a high-contrast mask of the brightest (or darkest) parts of your scene. This "luma key" can then be used to drive effects like a Glare node, so only the highlights will bloom.
        
    - **Organic (Luminance-Based Color Grading):** You can use the luminance of an image to control its own color grade.
        
        1. Take your main image and feed it into an RGB to BW node. This is your control mask.
            
        2. Create two different color grades for your main image (e.g., a warm version and a cool version).
            
        3. Use a Mix node. Connect the cool version to the top socket and the warm version to the bottom socket.
            
        4. Connect the Val output from the RGB to BW node into the Factor of the Mix node.
            
        5. The result is an image where the darkest parts are cool and the brightest parts are warm, with a smooth blend in between, all driven by the image's own brightness.
            
    - **Organic (Self-Displacement/Emboss Effect):** To create a stylized, chiseled look:
        
        1. Feed your image into an RGB to BW node.
            
        2. Connect the Val output to the Vector input of a Displace node.
            
        3. Connect your original color image to the Image input of the Displace node.
            
        4. The Displace node will now offset the pixels of the image based on their own brightness, creating a simple but effective emboss or relief effect.
