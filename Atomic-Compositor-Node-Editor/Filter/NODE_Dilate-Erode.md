- **Editor:** Compositor Node Editor  
- **Node Group:** Filter
    
- **Core Function:** Expands (**Dilate**) or shrinks (**Erode**) the white areas of a grayscale mask. It is a fundamental tool for refining mattes, closing holes, and creating outlines or borders.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Mask (Socket):** The grayscale mask input to be modified.
        
    - **Distance (Socket):** The primary control. Positive values **dilate** the mask, making the white areas grow and expand. Negative values **erode** the mask, making the white areas shrink and recede. The value is the distance in pixels.
        
    - **Mode (Property):** The algorithm used.
        
        - Distance: The most common and useful mode. It produces a high-quality expansion/contraction while preserving feathered (gray) edges.
            
        - Step: A faster, more "boxy" mode that can be useful for hard-edged, rectangular shapes.
            
        - Feather: This mode simply applies a blur, which is less precise than the other modes.
            
- **Practical Application:** This node is the key to cleaning up and perfecting masks generated by other nodes, making it a critical part of a professional compositing workflow.
    
    - **Molecular (Choking a Green Screen Key):** This is its most common and vital use. After you pull a key from green screen footage using a Keying node, you will often have a thin, faint green line around your subject.
        
        1. Take the matte output from your Keying node.
            
        2. Feed it into a Dilate / Erode node.
            
        3. Set the Distance to a small negative value (e.g., -1.5). This "erodes" the matte, shrinking it inwards by 1.5 pixels and cleanly cutting away the problematic green edge, resulting in a much more seamless composite.
            
    - **Molecular (Creating an Outline):** To create a simple outline or "stroke" around an object:
        
        1. Take your object's alpha mask.
            
        2. Feed it into a Dilate / Erode node with a positive Distance (e.g., 5). This creates a larger, fatter version of the mask.
            
        3. Use a Mix node set to Difference. In the top socket, put your original mask. In the bottom, put the dilated mask.
            
        4. The result is a perfect white outline of your object, which can then be colorized and composited.
            
    - **Organic (Closing Holes in Mattes):** Sometimes a Luma Key or procedural mask will have small, unwanted black holes or speckles inside the main white area.
        
        1. Dilate the mask with a positive value just large enough to make the white areas expand and cover the small holes.
            
        2. Follow this with a second Dilate / Erode node, this time with an equal negative value. This will Erode the mask back down to its original size.
            
        3. This "Dilate then Erode" molecule effectively fills in small gaps without significantly changing the overall shape of the mask. The reverse ("Erode then Dilate") can be used to remove small white speckles from the black areas.
