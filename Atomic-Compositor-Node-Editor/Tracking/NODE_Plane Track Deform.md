- **Editor:** Compositor Node Editor
    
- **Node Group:** Distort
    
- **Core Function:** Warps and deforms an input image so that it perfectly fits onto a Plane Track created in the Movie Clip Editor. It is the primary tool for performing screen replacements and adding elements to flat, moving surfaces in live-action footage.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Image (Socket):** The image or video clip you want to place onto the tracked surface (e.g., the new content for a smartphone screen).
        
    - **Movie Clip (Property):** Selects the movie clip that contains the plane track.
        
    - **Object (Property):** Selects the tracking object that contains the plane track.
        
    - **Track (Property):** Selects the specific Plane Track to use for the deformation.
        
    - **Motion Blur (Property Checkbox):** When enabled, it renders motion blur on the deformed image based on the track's movement, which is essential for seamless integration.
        
        - **Samples:** Controls the quality of the motion blur.
            
        - **Shutter:** Controls the duration/length of the motion blur streaks.
            
- **Outputs:**
    
    - **Image (Socket):** The input Image, perspectively warped and deformed to match the movement of the plane track.
        
    - **Plane (Socket):** A black-and-white mask of the tracked plane's shape and position on the current frame.
        
- **Practical Application:** This node is a cornerstone of motion graphics and VFX, used any time you need to "stick" an image onto a moving flat surface in your video.
    
    - **Molecular (Screen Replacement):** This is its most common and powerful use. You've filmed someone holding a phone with a blank screen.
        
        1. In the Movie Clip Editor, create a Plane Track that follows the four corners of the phone's screen.
            
        2. In the compositor, add a Plane Track Deform node. Select your movie clip and the plane track.
            
        3. Connect the new screen content (e.g., an Image node with a user interface graphic) to the Image input of the Plane Track Deform node.
            
        4. Use an Alpha Over node to composite the Image output (the warped screen) on top of your original footage. The new screen content will now be perfectly locked to the moving phone.
            
    - **Organic (Adding Posters/Signs to Walls):** To add a sign to a wall in a shot with a moving camera:
        
        1. Track a rectangular area on the wall where the sign should be.
            
        2. Use the Plane Track Deform node to warp your sign's artwork.
            
        3. Instead of a simple Alpha Over, you might want to Multiply the warped sign over the original footage to better integrate it with the wall's lighting and texture.
            
    - **Organic (Clean Plate Creation):** The Plane output is a powerful tool. Imagine you need to remove a logo from the side of a moving truck.
        
        1. Create a Plane Track of the logo.
            
        2. Use the Plane output as a mask to isolate the logo area from your footage.
            
        3. On a separate branch, create a "clean" patch of the truck's paint (e.g., by sampling a clean area and using a Transform node).
            
        4. Use the Plane output as a factor in a Mix node to composite the clean patch over the logo area. Because the mask is generated by the Plane Track Deform node, it will follow the truck's movement and perspective perfectly.
