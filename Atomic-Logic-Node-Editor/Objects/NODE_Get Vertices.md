- **Node Group:** Objects Part 4 - Object Data
    
- **Core Function:** Outputs a list of the positions of all vertices of an object's mesh.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Object):** The object from which to get the vertex data.
        
    - **Output (Vertices):** A list data block containing the vector coordinates of each vertex.
        
- **Practical Application:** Advanced procedural effects, such as making grass blades deform around a character's feet or creating a dynamic ripple effect on a water mesh by directly manipulating its vertices.
