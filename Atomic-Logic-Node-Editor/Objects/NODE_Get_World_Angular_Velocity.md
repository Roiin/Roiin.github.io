- **Core Function:** Retrieves the rate and axis of an object's rotation in world space. This applies only to objects with physics enabled.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Object (Socket):** The target dynamic object.
        
    - **World Angular Velocity (Socket):** A 3D vector output representing the speed of rotation around each world axis.
        
- **Practical Application:** Useful for controlling or reacting to spinning objects, such as stabilizing a rolling character or applying counter-torque to stop an object from spinning out of control.
