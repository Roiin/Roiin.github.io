- **Editor:** Logic Node Editor
    
- **Node Group:** Layout
    
- **Core Function:** A purely organizational node that acts as a redirect point for a connection line ("noodle"). It does not process or change data in any way.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Dot):** A single input socket.
        
    - **Output (Dot):** A single output socket that passes the input data through unchanged.
        
- **Practical Application:** Used to clean up a complex node graph. It allows you to add a "joint" to a connection line, enabling you to route it cleanly around other nodes instead of having it cross over them, which significantly improves readability.
