- **Core Function:** A visual organizational tool that creates a labeled box around a group of nodes. It has no logical function and does not affect the execution of the nodes within it.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Setting (Label):** A text field to give the frame a descriptive title.
        
    - **Setting (Color):** Allows you to change the background color of the frame.
        
    - **Setting (Label Size):** Adjusts the size of the title text.
