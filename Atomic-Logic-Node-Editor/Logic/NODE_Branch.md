- **Core Function:** A fundamental control flow node that functions as an "If/Else" statement. It directs the logic flow down one of two paths based on the state of a boolean condition.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A boolean value (true or false) that determines which path is taken.
        
    - **Output (True):** A flow control pulse that activates only if the input condition is true.
        
    - **Output (False):** A flow control pulse that activates only if the input condition is false.
        
- **Practical Application:** The cornerstone of decision-making. "Is the player's health less than or equal to 0? If True, activate the 'Player Death' sequence. If False, do nothing."
