- **Core Function:** Iterates through a list, similar to the Loop node. It processes each item in the list sequentially.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A boolean that must be true for the loop to run.
        
    - **Input (List):** The list to be iterated through.
        
    - **Setting (Type):** Defines the data type of the items in the list.
        
    - **Output (Loop):** A flow control pulse that activates for every item.
        
    - **Output (Value):** The current item being processed.
