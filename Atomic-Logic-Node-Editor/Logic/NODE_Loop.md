- **Core Function:** Iterates through a provided list of items, executing a logic branch once for each item in the list. This is a "For Each" loop.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A boolean that must be true for the loop to run.
        
    - **Input (Values):** The list to be iterated through.
        
    - **Setting (Type):** Defines the data type of the items in the list.
        
    - **Output (Loop):** A flow control pulse that activates for every item in the list.
        
    - **Output (Value):** The specific item being processed in the current iteration of the loop.
        
- **Practical Application:** For performing batch operations. "Get all enemy objects in a collection and feed them into the Values input. For each Value (enemy) that comes out of the Loop output, run a branch of logic to apply damage to it."
