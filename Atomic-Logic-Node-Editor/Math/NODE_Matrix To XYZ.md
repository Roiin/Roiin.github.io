- **Core Function:** Deconstructs a 3x3 transformation matrix into its component vectors (likely its local axes).
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Matrix):** The 3x3 matrix.
        
    - **Output (Vector X, Y, Z):** The three component vectors.
        
- **Practical Application:** Advanced operations involving object orientation. Used to get the local "forward," "up," and "right" vectors of an object after it has been rotated, which is useful for complex physics and character controllers.
