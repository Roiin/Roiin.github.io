- **Editor:** Logic Node Editor
    
- **Node Group:** Physics Part 2 - Character
    
- **Core Function:** Overrides the scene's default gravity for a specific character object.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A boolean flow control to trigger the action.
        
    - **Input (Object):** The character whose gravity will be changed.
        
    - **Input (Gravity):** A float value for the new gravity strength (e.g., a lower value for a "moon gravity" effect).
        
    - **Output (Done):** A flow control pulse that activates after the gravity is set.
        
- **Practical Application:** Used for creating special zones with different gravity, or for abilities like a "slow fall" or "anti-gravity" effect.
