- **Editor:** Logic Node Editor
    
- **Node Group:** Physics Part 3
    
- **Core Function:** Allows for the dynamic modification of various physics properties of an object.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A Boolean flow control to trigger the action.
        
    - **Input (Object):** The object to modify.
        
    - **Input (Active/Ghost/Cut Constraints):** Booleans to toggle specific physics states like activeness or collision response.
        
    - **Output (Done):** A flow control pulse that activates after the properties are set.
        
- **Practical Application:** A multi-purpose node for fine-tuning physics states, such as temporarily making an object a "ghost" that detects collisions but doesn't react to them.
