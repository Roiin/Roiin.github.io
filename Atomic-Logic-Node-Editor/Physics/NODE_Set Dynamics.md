- **Editor:** Logic Node Editor
    
- **Node Group:** Physics Part 3
    
- **Core Function:** Controls the dynamic state of an object, primarily used to stop or start its physics simulation.
    
- **Key Properties & Settings:**
    
    - **Input (Condition):** A Boolean flow control to trigger the action.
        
    - **Input (Object):** The object to affect.
        
    - **Setting (Active Tool...):** This likely corresponds to enabling/disabling dynamics, where disabling freezes an object in place.
        
    - **Output (Done):** A flow control pulse that activates after the state is changed.
        
- **Practical Application:** Freezing enemies in a stasis field or creating a "ragdoll" effect by enabling dynamics on a character's bones after death.
