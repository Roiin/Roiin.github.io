**Core Function:** Artificially rounds sharp edges at render time by manipulating shading, creating the illusion of a physical bevel to catch highlights without altering the geometry.

**Key Properties & Settings:**

- **Normal (Output):** The primary output. This provides the modified normal vector and should be connected to the Normal input of any BSDF shader node (e.g., Principled BSDF).
    
- **Radius:** Controls the virtual width of the rounded edge. Very small values are typically needed to create a believable effect.
    
- **Samples:** Determines the quality of the bevel calculation. Higher values produce smoother results but will increase render times.
    
- **Normal (Input):** Allows you to chain normal information. You can plug a Bump or Normal Map node into this socket to have the bevel effect calculated on top of the existing surface detail.
    

**Practical Application:**  
This node is invaluable for adding realism to hard-surface models. Consider creating a material for a new, machined steel block. In reality, even the sharpest machined edge has a microscopic curve that catches light. A 3D model with perfectly sharp, 90-degree edges looks fake and computer-generated.

The problem is that modeling these tiny bevels on complex geometry is destructive, time-consuming, and drastically increases the polygon count. The Bevel Node is the solution.

1. Create a standard Principled BSDF shader for the machined steel (high Metallic, low Roughness).
    
2. Add a Bevel Node and connect its Normal output to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF.
    
3. Set the Radius to a very small, physically plausible value (e.g., 0.005).
    
4. Upon rendering, the previously razor-sharp digital edges of the block will now realistically catch specular highlights, grounding the object in the scene. This achieves the desired visual effect of a high-poly, beveled model while maintaining the efficiency and flexibility of a simple, low-poly mesh.
